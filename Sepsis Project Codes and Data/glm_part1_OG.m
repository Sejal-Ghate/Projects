%import static training data (700 patients) - this is the basis of the simple model

%The header variable contains the meaning of each column of static_train
%generate simple glm
%define Y = observations which should be loaded from clinical table
Y = static_train(:,2);

%This currently only uses Gender as a covariate. % uses all?

%Phat is the estimated probability of sepsis occurence for patients
